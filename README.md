## What is vim-emu?

## Why this repository?

Older examples for vim-emu a spread over many different (and unfortunately outdated) project repositories. This makes it hard to get started with vim-emu. This project tries to change this.

## Examples

All the examples in this repository as placed in different folders to categorize them and keep all the required files to run them. In addition, there is a [vnfs/](vnfs/) folder that contains Dockerfiles to build all the VNFs used in the various examples. At the end, you only need to clone this repository and [install vim-emu](https://osm.etsi.org/wikipub/index.php/VIM_emulator) (using *Option 1: Bare-metal installation*) and you are ready to go.
