# vim-emu-examples
A collection of up-to-date examples for [vim-emu](https://osm.etsi.org/wikipub/index.php/VIM_emulator).

Older examples a spread over many different (and unfortunately outdated) project repositories. This makes it hard to get started with vim-emu. This project tries to change this.
